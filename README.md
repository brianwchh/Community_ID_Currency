in this page,I propose a community version of digital ID currency of national counterpart : https://github.com/brianwchh/ID_Currency.git , so that we can connect communities from all over the world to form a lot of small enclosure economical ecosystem! and since a community is just like a tiny small state,members in the community supervising their own currency, so it has the potential to replace all the encrypto currencies which are mostly confusing the users making them have doubt to use them. 
simple is beauty! community digital ID currency is such a easy understandable currency for everone,which also units the community members to become a strong group!
